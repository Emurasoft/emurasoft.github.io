# Q. How can I select the Everybody (all users) during installation?

The **per-computer/all users** installation option has been deprecated as of version 24.2. Instead, we now support the `[IniDir]` option for the portable version to set the settings folder. You can find more details about this option on [this page](https://www.emeditor.com/faq/installation-faq/how-can-the-portable-version-be-shared-by-all-users/).
