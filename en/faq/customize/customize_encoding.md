# Q. There is no encoding available in the Reload sub menu under the File menu except Same Encoding, Detect All, System Default, UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE, UTF-8, and UTF-7. How can I add more code pages?

If you do not install EmEditor properly, but just copy emeditor.exe from
another PC and run it, some system encodings will not be available in your copy
of EmEditor.

To setup additional system encodings, select the [**File Encodings** page](../../dlg/customize/encodings/index) of the **Customize** dialog box, and click the **Reset** button.

Encoding availability depends on which language system files you install in your copy of Windows. If you cannot find a particular encoding from within EmEditor, you can install additional language
files from Control Panel - Regional and Language Options. After language system files are installed in your copy of Windows,
select the [**File Encodings** page](../../dlg/customize/encodings/index) of the **Customize** dialog box, and click the **Reset** button.
