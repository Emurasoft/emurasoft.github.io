# Q. If I purchase EmEditor, can I get the newer version for free? Or do I have to pay for the registration fee every time I get a new version?

If you have a lifetime license, you’ll receive all future versions at no additional cost.

If you purchase a subscription, you’ll have access to all new versions released during your subscription period. Once your subscription expires or is canceled, you’ll need to renew it to continue using EmEditor and access the latest updates.
