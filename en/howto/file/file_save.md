# To Save an Edited File

1. Click ![Save](../../images/filesave.png) on the
Toolbar.
2. If the file is not named, the **Save As** dialog will be displayed,
allowing you to enter a name for the file.

## Tips

- If you want to save a previously saved file with a different name, select
the [**Save As** command](../../cmd/file/file_save_as) under the
**File** menu.
