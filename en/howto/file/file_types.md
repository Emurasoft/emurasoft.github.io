## Notes

- You can edit Unicode text files but languages that are written from
right to left such as Arabic and Hebrew may be edited incorrectly. Not all
Unicode control characters are supported.
- You can edit Unicode text files but it depends on the font. Some display
characters are not supported. You need to choose an appropriate font for the
language you wish to use.
- When a file contains [null characters](../../glossary/index), the [null characters](../../glossary/index) will be converted into spaces.
