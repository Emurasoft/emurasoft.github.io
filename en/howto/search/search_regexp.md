# To Use Regular Expressions

Regular expressions can be used to find text patterns within an open document
or in multiple files. A regular expression is a pattern of text that consists of
ordinary characters, or literals, (for example, letters a-z) and special
characters, known as metacharacters. The pattern describes one or more strings
to match when searching text.

To use regular expressions:

1. Select the **Find**(to find text patterns in the current file), **Replace** (to find text patterns and replace them), or **Find in Files**
option (to find text patterns in multiple files) under the **Search** menu.
2. Check the **Use Regular Expressions** box and any other search
parameters like **Match Case.**
3. Enter the regular expression to search for and click **Find**. If using **Find in Files,** also enter the file type(s) (separated with a semicolon if
more than one) and the folder(s) to search. If using **Replace**, also
enter the text to replace the found text pattern with (back references can
also be used - see below).
