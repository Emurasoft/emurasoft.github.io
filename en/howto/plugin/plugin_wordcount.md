# To Use Word Count Plug-in

The **Word Count** plug-in is installed by default with EmEditor Professional. This plug-in counts words contained in the entire document and in a selection of text. The word count plug-in always counts the words in the entire document. It
counts the words in a selection if you make a selection of text. To use the **Word Count** plug-in:

1. Select text where you want to count words or select no text to count the entire document.
2. Click **![Word Count](../../images/plugin_wordcount.png)** on the **Plug-ins** bar. Or on the **Tools** menu, point to **Plug-ins**, and then click **Word Count**.

The **Word Count** custom bar appears. In the first column, the plug-in displays the types of query: characters, width, words, and lines. In the second column, the plug-in displays the count of words in the entire document. In the third column, the
plug-in displays the count of words in the selected text only.

You can click the **Refresh Now** button to recount the document and/or selection and update the word count, or press the " **Refresh Automatically**" button to reflect changes immediately. (This does not apply to a selection of text.)

The **Word Count Plug-in** queries are customizable. Click on the **Customize** button of the **Word Count** bar. The **Customize Queries** dialog box appears where you can create new, delete, copy and order queries. You can also click **Reset** to return all queries to
the default settings.

## To create a new query (such as Uppercase characters):

1. Click **New** in the **Customize Queries** dialog box. The **Query Properties** box appears.
2. Name the new query in the **Title** text box.
3. Specify the type by Number of **Characters**, **Widths**, **Number of Words**, or **Logical Lines**.
4. Select the **Use Regular Expression** check box. Some **Regular Expression** examples are available by clicking the > button next to the text box.

**Tips:**

Properties of an existing query, can also be edited by selecting the query to edit in the Customize Queries dialog box, and clicking Properties.
