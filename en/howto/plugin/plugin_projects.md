### Solution Templates

Every solution you create, open or save in the Projects plug-in belongs to a solution template. Each solution template specifies the associated file extension's characteristics, including solution formats, macros, tools, and keyboard shortcuts.
When you open a solution file, a solution template associated with the file extension is selected and behaves per the characteristics defined for the template.

### Solution Templates dialog box

This dialog box appears when you click the ![](../../images/solutiontemplates.png) button. Available solution templates are displayed in the list. Click the Properties button to display the properties of the selected solution template.

### Solution Template Properties

| --- | --- |
| **Solution Format** | selects a solution format. Currently, only **EmEditor** and **Visual Studio** can be selected. |
| **File Extension** | specifies the file extension for solution files. When you open a solution file, a solution template associated with the file extension is selected. |
| **Read Only** | specifies whether the solution is read only. If you set to read only, you won't be able to add files to the solution, and the project files won't be overridden when a solution is saved. |
| **Files to Include** | specifies file types that are included when you drag and drop files to a project tree. For example, you would specify "\*.c;\*.cpp" if you would like to include both .c and .cpp files. |
