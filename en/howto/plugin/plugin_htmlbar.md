In order to customize the toolbar buttons:

1. Right click ![](../../images/htmlbar.png) on the **Plug-in toolbar**, then click **Properties**. The **HTML Bar Properties** box is displayed.

The **Customize Buttons** dialog box will appear. The predefined buttons are listed. You can click the **New** button to add a new button, or the **Properties** button to edit the selected button.

## Tips

By default, the **HTMLBar** plug-in doesn't appear automatically when an **HTML** file is opened. You can change this behavior from the **plug-in Properties**, which can be accessed by right-clicking the **plug-in button** on the **Plug-ins** bar, and selecting the
**Properties**.
