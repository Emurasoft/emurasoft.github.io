# To Use Explorer Plug-in

The **Explorer** plug-in is installed by default with EmEditor Professional. This plug-in displays the folder tree and allows you to open a file from the folder tree. To use the **Explorer** plug-in:

1. Click **![Explorer](../../images/plugin_explorer.png)** on the **Plug-ins** bar. Or on the **Tools** menu, point to **Plug-ins**, and then click **Explorer**. The **Explorer** custom bar will appear.
2. Find and click a file to open from the folder tree, and the file will be opened with EmEditor.

## Tips

- Press the **F6** key or **ESC** key to set the keyboard focus back to the editor.
- To enter the path directly, use the **Path** drop-down list.
- Â To display only certain file types, set the filter in the Filter drop-down list. Wild cards (**\***, **?**) can be used. To separate multiple file specifications, use a semicolon (**;**).
- Right-click on the list to view hidden files, refresh, or clear the **Path** and **Filter** history.
- Single-click opens an item by default. You can change this behavior from the plug-in properties.
