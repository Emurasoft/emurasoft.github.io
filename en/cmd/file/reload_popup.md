# Reload (popup menu) command

## Summary

Shows a popup menu to select an encoding to reload the file with.

## Description

This command displays a popup menu, from which you can select an encoding
to use for reloading. After an encoding is selected, this command reloads
the file from the disk. If changes were made to the file since it was last reloaded
or opened, this command will replace the document with the latest contents.
If the document was changed within EmEditor, the prompt message "Are you sure
you want to abandon changes?" appears. Selecting **Yes** will
discard the
changes without saving, and will reload the new contents. Selecting **No**
will abort reloading and will allow you to continue editing the document.
