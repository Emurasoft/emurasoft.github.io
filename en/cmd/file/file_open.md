# Open command

## Summary

Opens an existing file.

## Description

This command displays the **Open** dialog box, and allows you to select a file you would like to open with EmEditor. Normally, the file will open in a new tab. However, the file will open within the current
tab if the current tab is untitled and no characters have been typed. If you wish to open a new file within the current tab every time, use the [**Close and Open** command](file_close_open).
