# Version 10

June 30, 2010

## New General Features

- **Compare** and **Synchronize Scrolling** features were added.
- **Spelling** features were added.
- Vertical selection of zero width at the right of end of lines will cause the selection move to end of each line in the selection. Then typing will insert text at end of each line (even if line lengths are not the same).
- The new [**Numbering** command](../cmd/insert/numbering) allows you to insert sequential numbers or characters at the cursor position or vertical selection.
- The **CSV** mode now allows you to include newline characters in a cell. Embedded returns are displayed as **M** (CR) and/or **J** (LF) in the reversed background color when the **Show Control Characters** check box is checked in the
**Marks** page of configuration properties.
- The context menu displayed by right-clicking on a folder in Windows Explorer now includes the new **Find in Files with EmEditor** command.
- The **auto recovery** feature now opens the last used workspace automatically (the **Recovered Files** dialog has been deprecated). When updating EmEditor with the new installer, EmEditor windows will be automatically closed, and they will be reopened as the last used workspace.
- The new installer now allows several language editions in a single installer (currently English and Japanese are included).
- The new **Update Checker** that came with the new installer
is now used (v9 **Update Checker** has been deprecated).
- New command line option **/cmp** was added.
- When localized language files are old, EmEditor now automatically uses English strings and dialog box resources whenever possible.
- EmEditor now supports a combination of left (&l), center (&c), and right (&r) align for Print header and footer.
- Binary (Hexadecimal View) mode now includes ASCII view side by side.
- Vertical selection is now limited to logical selections (multiple selections because of line wraps
are no longer allowed).
- In the previous version, a new untitled document was opened after
canceling the dialog box that appears when reloading a file with invalid
characters. This has been fixed, except when opening a huge file
asynchronously.
- Default PHP highlight strings were updated to the latest PHP function list.
- A new replacement expression (?n:true\_expression:false\_expression) was added to the [regular expression syntax](../howto/search/search_regexp_syntax).

## New plug-in features

- **Hide matched strings/replace with regular expressions** check box and **Regular Expression** text box were added to allow you to hide matched strings or replace matched strings with regular expressions.

### Explorer plug-in
