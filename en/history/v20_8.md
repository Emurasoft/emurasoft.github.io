# Version 20.8

June 8, 2021

## New General Features

- Improved the **Find**/ **Replace** behavior in the **Binary (Hexadecimal View)** mode, and allowed you to search visually multiple lines for an array of bytes without considering newlines.
- Added the **Ruler** for the **Binary (Hexadecimal View)** mode.
- Improved **UTF-8 detection** in very large files (If EmEditor detects an invalid character while opening a file as UTF-8, it will be opened as the originally selected encoding).
- Enabled the **[Find Matching Parenthesis/Bracket](../cmd/edit/next_paren)**( **Ctrl+\]**) and **[Matching Parenthesis/Bracket Extend](../cmd/edit/shift_next_paren)**( **Ctrl+Shift+\]**) commands even if the cursor is not exactly at the parenthesis/bracket position.

## New Options

- Added the **Validate XML documents (XML)** and **Resolve external definitions (XML)** check boxes to the [**Syntax Check** page](../dlg/customize/validation/index) of the **Customize** dialog box.
- Added the **Create log files to debug in the Downloads folder** check box to the [**Update** page](../dlg/customize/update/index) of the **Customize** dialog box.
- Added the **Even Lines** to the [**Display** page](../dlg/properties/display/index) of **configuration properties** to allow you to set a different color for alternate lines.
- The new version allows the **First Line** text box in the [**Insert Numbering** dialog box](../dlg/insert_numbering/index) to include a prefix and/or a suffix unless the **Character** radio button is selected.

## Plug-in New Features

- Supported multiple selections in the [**HTMLBar** plug-in](../howto/plugin/plugin_htmlbar).

## Macro New Features

- Added the [**#async** directive](../macro/directive/async) to allow an option for a macro to run synchronously (not as a separate thread) as the same way as v20.6 or earlier.
- Disabled keyboard input to the editor while running macros even asynchronously (as a separate thread).
