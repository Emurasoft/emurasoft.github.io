# Version 25.2

June 18th, 2025

## New General Features

- Enhanced the [**Chat with AI** features](../howto/plugin/plugin_chat_with_ai), allowing you to use additional AI services including local AI models installed via LM Studio, Deepseek, other compatible AI services. To use AI services other than OpenAI, you need to specify the AI service you want to use in the settings of the **Chat with AI** window. {{pro}}
- The new version allows you to configure the date and time formats for the **sort** functions. Previously, the Windows Automation function was used, but it lacked support for detecting the exact date and time formats. The previous behavior is still used if date and time formats are omitted.
- The **Toolbars** dialog box has been moved to the **Toolbar Options** and **Toolbar Buttons** pages of the **Customize** dialog box. The new UI allows any command to be added as a button, not just predefined buttons.

## New Options

- Added the **Use default date formats** check box and drop-down list to the [**Sort** page](../dlg/customize/sort/index) of the **Customize** dialog box. {{pro}}
- Added the [**Toolbar Options**](../dlg/customize/toolbar_options/index) and [**Toolbar Buttons**](../dlg/customize/toolbar_buttons/index) pages to the **Customize** dialog box. Also added the [**Toolbar Button Properties** dialog box](../dlg/customize/toolbar_buttons/properties/index). {{pro}}
