# Version 25.2

June 24th, 2025

## New General Features

- Starting with this version, only 64-bit editions of Windows 8.1 and later are supported and optimized. EmEditor v25.1 is the last version to support Windows 7 or 32-bit editions. {{profree}}
- Enhanced the [**Chat with AI** features](../howto/plugin/plugin_chat_with_ai), allowing you to use additional AI services including local AI models installed via [**LM Studio**](https://lmstudio.ai/), [**Deepseek**](https://www.deepseek.com/), other compatible AI services. To use AI services other than **OpenAI**, you need to specify the AI service you want to use in the settings of the **Chat with AI** window. Settings for API keys and options for AI Prompts were moved to **Chat with AI** settings. {{pro}}
- The new version allows you to configure the date and time formats for the **sort** functions. Previously, an API function for Windows Automation was used, but it lacked support for detecting the exact date and time formats. Specifying the date and time formats increases the sort speed. The previous behavior is still used if date and time formats are omitted. {{pro}}
- The **Toolbars** dialog box has been moved to the **Toolbar Options** and **Toolbar Buttons** pages of the **Customize** dialog box. The new UI allows any command to be added as a button, not just predefined buttons. In addition to basic toolbars, you can now also customize the Find, Filter, and Markdown toolbars. {{pro}}
- If a macro file does not have a Unicode signature (BOM), the new version displays a dialog box that allows you to select the encoding with which the file should be opened. {{pro}}
- Improved the speed of startup and the date filter.
