- The new version allows you to use any encoding when opening, reloading, or saving files without first defining them in the **Define Encodings** dialog box. Selecting "More..." in the **Encoding** drop-down list box or the **Reload** menu will show additional encodings. The initial list of encodings can be customized via the **Encoding** list in the **Define Encodings** dialog box.
- If **Dark** mode is used in Windows 10, EmEditor will also use dark colors. EmEditor displays custom bars, drop-down list boxes in the **Find**/**Filter** toolbars, text boxes, and list boxes inside dialog boxes in dark colors when **Dark** mode is selected in the Colors tab under Personalization in Windows Settings. Some of these colors can be further customized in the [**View** page](../dlg/customize/view/index) of the **Customize** dialog box. Editor view colors becomes dark colors when selecting the **MinimalZen** in the **Display** page of configuration properties.
- Increased the number of icons that can be used in the [**Associate with EmEditor** dialog box](../dlg/file_associate/index).

## New Options

- Added the **Prompt when creating a new file in a network path** check box to the [**File** page](../dlg/customize/file/index) of the **Customize** dialog box.
- Deleted the **Black**, **Blue**, **Brick**, **EmEditor Classic**, and **Rose** themes from the **Display** page of configuration properties.
- Added the **Enable/Disable All** check box to the **Define Encodings** dialog box, and removed the **New**, **Delete**, **Up**, **Down**, **Properties** buttons from the dialog box. The **Encoding Properties** dialog box was deprecated.
- Removed the **Open Undefined as System Default Encoding** check box from the [**Detect All Result** dialog box](../dlg/detect_result/index).
