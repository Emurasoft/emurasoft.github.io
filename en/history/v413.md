# Version 4.13

February 17, 2005

- Fixed a bug that the [**Find in Files** command](../cmd/search/grep) failed to search files with unassociated extensions with correct encodings.
- When saving an empty file, you can now choose to delete the file, save as an empty file, or cancel the save command.
- [**Toggle Horizontal Split** command](../cmd/window/window_split_horz_toggle) and [**Toggle Vertical Split** command](../cmd/window/window_split_vert_toggle)
added.
- Changed the meaning of the Toolbar button ![](../images/windowsplithorzfix.png)
to [**Toggle Horizontal Split** command](../cmd/window/window_split_horz_toggle).
