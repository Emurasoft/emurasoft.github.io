# Version 24.1

March 27th, 2024

## New General Features

- Added a shortcut to Windows 11 context menu in Explorer. To use this feature, the EmEditor tray icon must be visible in the notification area of the Windows taskbar. (Desktop Installer versions only) {{profree}}
- Added the ability to complete a word or phrase by using [**OpenAI**](https://openai.com/). The suggested text is displayed in gray by default, and you can accept it by pressing the **Tab** or **End** key. If you only want to confirm a part of the suggestion, press the **Right** arrow key ("â†’") for the number of characters you want to accept, or **Ctrl+Right** to accept one word. Pressing the **Delete** key will remove the first character of the suggested text. Pressing the **Esc** key or another key cancels the suggestion. Furthermore, if you want to force a prediction by AI when there is no proposed text displayed or if you want a different suggestion, press **Ctrl+Space**. The feature requires an [**OpenAI API key**](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to use. {{pro}}
