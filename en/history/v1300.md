- When creating a new file by specifying a non-existing file name in the Open dialog box, EmEditor will now create a zero-byte empty file.

- The new **Fast Binary Comparison (Ignore Locale)** allows for faster sort. Clearing the **Stable Sort** also allows for faster sort when stable sorting is not necessary.

- EmEditor Free is back! This time, EmEditor Free is the same executable file as EmEditor Professional. After you try EmEditor Professional for 30 days, you can still use EmEditor Free without purchasing the product for personal use only.
- When a user clicks on the left edge or the line numbers, a menu related to bookmarks now appears.
- /ff and /mc command line options allow you to find a string in an
opened document.
