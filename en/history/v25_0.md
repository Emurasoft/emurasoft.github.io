# Version 25.0

March , 2025

## New General Features

- EmEditor Professional no longer includes AI-related features by default. To keep using these features, you'll need to install the **ChatAI** plug-in separately. After installation, all AI-related commands will be conveniently grouped under a new **AI** menu. The **ChatAI** plugin is only available on the 64-bit desktop version of EmEditor. Unfortunately, AI features aren't supported on either the 32-bit or the Store version of EmEditor. {{pro}}
- In **Markdown Design View**, HTML tags in the source text are now displayed as they appear. Additionally, character references and numeric character references are properly decoded and shown correctly. {{pro}}
- You can now stack multiple custom bars, with buttons at the bottom allowing you to quickly switch between them. {{profree}}
- The **Very Dark** option is now enabled by default. When **Dark Mode** is activated in Windows, EmEditor's menus, toolbars, and other elements will automatically switch to dark mode. {{profree}}
- The new version automatically removes older installers from the downloads folder during updates. {{profree}}
- Added the **Synchronize with Find** command to the menu that pops up when you click the button next to the **Replace** drop-down box in the **Find** toolbar. {{pro}}
