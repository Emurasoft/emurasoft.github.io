# Version 25.0

March 4th, 2025

## New General Features

- EmEditor Professional no longer includes AI-related features by default. To keep using these features, you'll need to download and install the [**ChatAI** plug-in](https://www.emeditor.com/download-chatai/) separately. After installing the plug-in, all AI-related commands will be conveniently grouped under a new **AI** menu. The **ChatAI** plug-in is only available on the 64-bit desktop version of EmEditor. Unfortunately, AI features aren't supported on either the 32-bit or the Store version of EmEditor. {{pro}}
- In **Markdown Design View**, HTML tags in the source text are now displayed as they appear. Additionally, character references and numeric character references are properly decoded and shown correctly. {{pro}}
- You can now stack multiple custom bars, with buttons at the bottom allowing you to quickly switch between them. {{profree}}
- The **Very Dark** option is now enabled by default. When **Dark Mode** is activated in Windows, EmEditor's menus, toolbars, and other elements will automatically switch to dark mode. {{profree}}
- The new version automatically removes older installers from the downloads folder during updates. {{profree}}
- When you click the button next to the **Search** drop-down list on the **Find** toolbar, we've added new commands to this menu: **Selected Text or Word at Cursor**, **Selected Text**, **Word at Cursor**, **Last Used Value**, **Fixed Value**, and **Auto Save**. By default, using the **Set Focus to Find Toolbar** command (Ctrl+D) sets the search string to either the selected text or the word at the cursor position. If you prefer the previous setting, choose **Last Used Value**.
- Added a **Synchronize with Find** command to the menu that appears when you click the button next to the **Replace** drop-down list on the **Find** toolbar. {{pro}}
- You can now easily register a macro file by simply dragging and dropping it onto a basic toolbar, as long as the file has a `.jsee` or `.vbee` extension. If the macro file isn't already in My Macros, it will be added automatically. {{pro}}
- Previous versions disable line wrapping when very long lines are present. This version removes the limitation. {{profree}}

## Plug-in New Features

- Added the **Create New Document** command to the context menu in the **Chat with AI** custom bar (ChatAI plug-in). {{pro}}
- The **gpt-4.5-preview** model was added to the **Preferred Model** list box in the [**AI Options** page](../dlg/customize/ai/index) of the **Customize** dialog box (ChatAI plug-in). {{pro}} 
- A new **HD** checkbox has been added to the [**New Prompt** dialog](../dlg/new_prompt/index) and the [**AI Prompt** page](../dlg/customize/ai_list/index) in the **Customize** dialog when **Image** is selected for **Output**. If the **HD** checkbox is not selected, images will be generated at normal resolution (ChatAI plug-in).
- Added the **EI_IS_CHATAI_INSTALLED** command to [**EE_INFO** message](../plugin/message/ee_info). {{pro}}
